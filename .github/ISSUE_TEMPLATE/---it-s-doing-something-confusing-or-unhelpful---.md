**What were you trying to do, and what did you expect to happen?**

**What happened instead?**

**If you try it again (either/both of: exactly the same and/or a little different but with comparable expectations), does it happen again? If so, every time or only sometimes?  ** 

**If only sometimes, can you find (and share) a rule or example(s) (of steps, input, circumstances) that makes it happen repeatedly? Please be detailed.**


**Was this on a phone or computer or ?**
